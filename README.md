#### communicate-data-findings

Introduction

This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan,  including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan  status, borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit  history, and the latest payment information.
 
### Summary of findings 

The main purposes of this project are to summarize the characteristics of  variables that can affect the loan status and to get some ideas about the  relationships among multiple variables using summary statistics and data  visualizations.

In the exploration the following has been shown:  

- Loan Term: The length of time a borrower has to repay a loan affects the outcome of the loan. Longer loan terms may provide more flexibility for the borrower, but may also increase their risk of defaulting.This will be compared to another factor in bivariate so we can come to a conclusion on how it affects repayment etc.

- Observing the employment status data the the borrower who are employed and who work full-time have a higer rating than others meaning employment does play a major role when it comes to a loan status being approved and it does play important factor.

- It has come to light that the employment and Rating is showing the distribution of ProsperRating for each value of EmploymentStatus. We can see that for most EmploymentStatus categories, the majority of loans have a ProsperRating of C or D. However, there are some differences between categories: for example, self-employed borrowers are more likely to have a ProsperRating of HR (high-risk) than borrowers who are employed or retired.

-Customers who have a credit grade of C, D and B have a higher chance of getting a loan whereas NC has a lower chance of getting a loan.A higher creditscore  indicate a lower risk of default and, therefore, a higher likelihood of loan approval.

-From the bar graph people who are employed are in high numbers compared to a person who is not employed, retired or works part-time and the rest of the employment status.Status which is showing full-time and self employes is showing a higher rating meaning employment does 
play a major role when it comes to a loan status being approved.

- The debt to income ratio and Borrower APR the plot show a relation between the two variables, when one increase the other also increase. This suggest that borrowers with a higher DebtToIncomeRatio the more likely to get higher APR.

- In term and employment the heatmap We can say that the graph suggets that most borrowers have a loan term of 36 months and are employed full-time or have another source of income.

### Key insights 

- The relationship between the rating and in ratio debt income ratio is lower. 

What effects the borrowers APR or interest rate in prosper loan ?

The borrower's APR or interest rate in a Prosper loan is determined by a number of factors, including their credit score, debt-to-income ratio, loan amount, loan purpose, and loan term. Additionally, Prosper takes into account the borrower's past payment history, the amount of available funds in the borrower's account, and the borrower's listing category even though not all of the variables are not covered most of the them are analysed.
