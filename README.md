#### communicate-data-findings

Introduction 
This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan,  including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan  status, borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit  history, and the latest payment information.
 
### Summary of findings 

The main purposes of this project are to summarize the characteristics of  variables that can affect the loan status and to get some ideas about the  relationships among multiple variables using summary statistics and data  visualizations.

In the exploration the following has been shown 

- Borrowers with the best Prosper rating have the best APR. 
- Relationship between borrower interest and loan amount turns from negative to slightly positive when the propser ratings are increased.
- Loan amount increase with the loan term
- In the first graph employed customers status is showing in all the terms, showing the highest.In term for 36 months employed customers are the highest followed by full-time employment.The 60 months employment is still showing the highest this could mean when one is employed there is a greater chance of getting a loan dispite the term of the loan.

The next graph also shows employment in across all the prosper rating, especially C,B,A and D.
- Borrower APR decrease with the increase of borrow term for HR-C ratings.
- The loan term increase with the the longer the loan term. 
- Debt-to-Income Ratio is right skewed when it is less than or equal 1. The entries larger than 1 still will not change the it is right skewed. 
-Monthly income and original amount have a positive correlation.This could be based on the fact that the higher the income the higher the loan. 
- When the borrowers rating improve the lower the APR. 
-Term does not seem to have much effect on the relationship between the loam amount and APR. 
- The APR decreases when the term is longer for rating B-AA, the longer thier term the higher the APR for each persons level.
